# BasicSnakeGame
Quick little snake game in javascript, did this as a fun way to get better with javascript syntax.

I'm currently not aware of any errors and don't think there are any but if you find one let me know!
Going to update it to add a scoreboard and possibly make it a little prettier. I'm not great with HTML and CSS so probably not gonna make it prettier.
